                    <h3>Amalfi Beach</h3>
                    <p> Amalfi is a town and comune in the
                        province of Salerno, in the region of Campania,
                        Italy, on the Gulf of Salerno. It lies at the mouth of a deep ravine, at the foot of Monte
                        Cerreto (1,315 metres, 4,314 feet), surrounded by dramatic cliffs and coastal scenery.
                        The town of Amalfi was the capital of the maritime republic known as the Duchy of Amalfi, an
                        important trading power in the Mediterranean between 839 and around 1200.
                        In the 1920s and 1930s, Amalfi was a popular holiday destination for the British upper class and
                        aristocracy Amalfi is the main town of the coast on which it is located, named Costiera
                        Amalfitana (Amalfi Coast),
                        and is today an important tourist destination together with other towns on the same coast, such
                        as Positano, Ravello and others. Amalfi is included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
                        A patron saint of Amalfi is Saint Andrew, the Apostle, whose relics are kept here at Amalfi
                        Cathedral (Cattedrale di Sant'Andrea/Duomo di Amalfi).

                        <h2>Hey I am Ema</h2>
                        <p>...and I'm obsessed with getting lost in new places and meeting new faces.
                            From remote Atlantic Islands full of Penguins, to bustling Italian cities crammed with amazing
                            architecture.
                            I've been lucky enough to turn my passion for travel and photography into my job, and spent four
                            years
                            travelling full time before settling down in Portugal - a far cry from the life I thought
                            I would have when I left my London restaurant managers job. This website is full of my favourite
                            places
                            and people,
                            and stories from the road - I hope it can help you explore the world a little bit
                            better through tips, advice, and personal stories. Safe travels!
